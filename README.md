# MPC-with-PHE

Proof of concept code for implementing a Model Predictive Control problem on encrypted data in Python. More details can be found in the paper "Cloud-based MPC with Encrypted Data" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09891.pdf.

At the momemnt, only the code for the Client-Server architecture is added. The code for the Two-Server architecture will follow shortly.
